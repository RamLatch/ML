    "Dropout is a regularization technique used in NN to mitigate overfitting. It randomly deactivates a fraction of the units during training, forcing the network to learn more robust representations. This prevents co-adaptation of neurons and improves generalization. In inference, the dropout is often disabled. Monte Carlo dropout extends this approach by performing dropout even in inference, and average the result of multiple forward passes to provide a measure of uncertainty.\n",

Based on the above information, how can we enable dropout in inference mode?"
